## Code examples

According to the Reactive Streams specification, their stages (producers, processors, consumers) can be synchronous (executed in the thread of the previous stage) or asynchronous (executed in another thread). Below are code examples of synchronous and asynchronous producers and consumers working in pairs. (The GitHub repository also has examples of how a _synchronous_ publisher works with _asynchronous_ subscribers and how an _asynchronous_ publisher works with _synchronous_ subscribers). The comments in the code examples show which code fragments are responsible for implementing which rules of the Reactive Streams specification.


### Synchronous publisher and subscriber

The following code example demonstrates a synchronous _cold_ Publisher that sends a finite sequence of items from a given Iterator.


```
public class SyncIteratorPublisher<T> implements Flow.Publisher<T> {

   private final Supplier<Iterator<? extends T>> iteratorSupplier;

   public SyncIteratorPublisher(Supplier<Iterator<? extends T>> iteratorSupplier) {
       this.iteratorSupplier = Objects.requireNonNull(iteratorSupplier);
   }

   @Override
   public void subscribe(Flow.Subscriber<? super T> subscriber) {
       // By rule 1.11, a Publisher may support multiple Subscribers and decide whether each Subscription is unicast or multicast.
       new SubscriptionImpl(subscriber);
   }

   private class SubscriptionImpl implements Flow.Subscription {

       private final Flow.Subscriber<? super T> subscriber;
       private final AtomicLong demand = new AtomicLong();
       private final AtomicBoolean cancelled = new AtomicBoolean(false);

       private Iterator<? extends T> iterator;

       SubscriptionImpl(Flow.Subscriber<? super T> subscriber) {
           // By rule 1.9, calling Publisher.subscribe must throw a NullPointerException when the given parameter is null.
           this.subscriber = Objects.requireNonNull(subscriber);

           try {
               iterator = iteratorSupplier.get();
           } catch (Throwable throwable) {
               // By rule 1.9, a Publisher must call onSubscribe prior onError if Publisher.subscribe(Subscriber subscriber) fails.
               subscriber.onSubscribe(new Flow.Subscription() {
                   @Override
                   public void cancel() {
                   }

                   @Override
                   public void request(long n) {
                   }
               });
               // By rule 1.4, if a Publisher fails it must signal an onError.
               doError(throwable);
           }

           if (!cancelled.get()) {
               subscriber.onSubscribe(this);
           }
       }

       @Override
       public void request(long n) {
           logger.info("subscription.request: {}", n);

           // By rule 3.9, while the Subscription is not cancelled, Subscription.request(long n) must signal onError with a IllegalArgumentException if the argument is <= 0.
           if ((n <= 0) && !cancelled.get()) {
               doCancel();
               subscriber.onError(new IllegalArgumentException("non-positive subscription request"));
               return;
           }

           for (;;) {
               long oldDemand = demand.getAcquire();
               if (oldDemand == Long.MAX_VALUE) {
                   return;
               }

               // By rule 3.8, while the Subscription is not cancelled, Subscription.request(long n) must register the given number of additional elements to be produced to the respective Subscriber.
               long newDemand = oldDemand + n;
               if (newDemand < 0L) {
                   // By rule 3.17, a Subscription must support a demand up to Long.MAX_VALUE.
                   newDemand = Long.MAX_VALUE;
               }

               // By rule 3.3, Subscription.request must place an upper bound on possible synchronous recursion between Publisher and Subscriber.
               if (demand.compareAndSet(oldDemand, newDemand)) {
                   if (oldDemand > 0) {
                       return;
                   }
                   break;
               }
           }

           // By rule 1.2, a Publisher may signal fewer onNext than requested and terminate the Subscription by calling onError.
           for (; demand.get() > 0 && iterator.hasNext() && !cancelled.get(); demand.decrementAndGet()) {
               try {
                   subscriber.onNext(iterator.next());
               } catch (Throwable throwable) {
                   if (!cancelled.get()) {
                       // By rule 1.6, if a Publisher signals onError on a Subscriber, that Subscriber's Subscription must be considered cancelled.
                       doCancel();
                       // By rule 1.4, if a Publisher fails it must signal an onError.
                       subscriber.onError(throwable);
                   }
               }
           }

           // By rule 1.2, a Publisher may signal fewer onNext than requested and terminate the Subscription by calling onComplete.
           if (!iterator.hasNext() && !cancelled.get()) {
               // By rule 1.6, if a Publisher signals onComplete on a Subscriber, that Subscriber's Subscription must be considered cancelled.
               doCancel();
               // By rule 1.5, if a Publisher terminates successfully it must signal an onComplete.
               subscriber.onComplete();
           }
       }

       @Override
       public void cancel() {
           logger.info("subscription.cancel");
           doCancel();
       }

       private void doCancel() {
           logger.info("subscription.cancelled");
           cancelled.set(true);
       }

       private void doError(Throwable throwable) {
           // By rule 1.6, if a Publisher signals onError on a Subscriber, that Subscriber's Subscription must be considered cancelled.
           cancelled.set(true);
           subscriber.onError(throwable);
       }
   }
}
```


The following code sample demonstrates a synchronous Subscriber that _pulls_ items one by one and logs received events. This synchronous Subscriber executes its methods onSubscribe, onNext, onError, onComplete in a Publisherâ€™s thread. The GitHub repository also has blackbox and whitebox unit tests to verify that this Subscriber meets the specification using its TCK.


```
public class SyncSubscriber<T> implements Flow.Subscriber<T> {

   private final int id;
   private final CountDownLatch completed = new CountDownLatch(1);

   private Flow.Subscription subscription;
   private boolean cancelled = false;

   public SyncSubscriber(int id) {
       this.id = id;
   }

   @Override
   public void onSubscribe(Flow.Subscription subscription) {
       logger.info("({}) subscriber.subscribe: {}", id, subscription);
       // By rule 2.13, calling onSubscribe must throw a NullPointerException when the given parameter is null.
       Objects.requireNonNull(subscription);

       if (this.subscription != null) {
           // By rule 2.5, a Subscriber must call Subscription.cancel() on the given Subscription after an onSubscribe signal if it already has an active Subscription.
           subscription.cancel();
       } else {
           this.subscription = subscription;
           // By rule 2.1, a Subscriber must signal demand via Subscription.request(long n) to receive onNext signals.
           this.subscription.request(1);
       }
   }

   @Override
   public void onNext(T item) {
       logger.info("({}) subscriber.next: {}", id, item);
       // By rule 2.13, calling onNext must throw a NullPointerException when the given parameter is null.
       Objects.requireNonNull(item);

       // By rule 2.8, a Subscriber must be prepared to receive one or more onNext signals after having called Subscription.cancel()
       if (!cancelled) {
           if (whenNext(item)) {
               // By rule 2.1, a Subscriber must signal demand via Subscription.request(long n) to receive onNext signals.
               subscription.request(1);
           } else {
               // By rule 2.6, a Subscriber must call Subscription.cancel() if the Subscription is no longer needed.
               doCancel();
           }
       }
   }

   @Override
   public void onError(Throwable throwable) {
       logger.error("({}) subscriber.error", id, throwable);
       // By rule 2.13, calling onError must throw a NullPointerException when the given parameter is null.
       Objects.requireNonNull(throwable);

       // By rule 2.4, Subscriber.onError(Throwable t) must consider the Subscription cancelled after having received the signal.
       cancelled = true;
       whenError(throwable);
   }

   @Override
   public void onComplete() {
       logger.info("({}) subscriber.complete", id);

       // By rule 2.4, Subscriber.onComplete() must consider the Subscription cancelled after having received the signal.
       cancelled = true;
       whenComplete();
   }

   public void awaitCompletion() throws InterruptedException {
       completed.await();
   }

   // This method is invoked when OnNext signals arrive and returns whether more elements are desired or not (is intended to override).
   protected boolean whenNext(T item) {
       return true;
   }

   // This method is invoked when an OnError signal arrives (is intended to override).
   protected void whenError(Throwable throwable) {
   }

   // This method is invoked when an OnComplete signal arrives (is intended to override).
   protected void whenComplete() {
       completed.countDown();
   }

   private void doCancel() {
       cancelled = true;
       subscription.cancel();
   }
}
```


The following code example demonstrates that the _multicast_ Publisher sends the same sequence of events (_[The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_quick_brown_fox_jumps_over_the_lazy_dog)_ pangram) to multiple Subscribers.


```
List<String> list = List.of("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.".split(" "));
SyncIteratorPublisher<String> publisher = new SyncIteratorPublisher<>(() -> List.copyOf(list).iterator());

SyncSubscriber<String> subscriber1 = new SyncSubscriber<>(1);
publisher.subscribe(subscriber1);

SyncSubscriber<String> subscriber2 = new SyncSubscriber<>(2);
publisher.subscribe(subscriber2);

subscriber1.awaitCompletion();
subscriber2.awaitCompletion();
```


The following log demonstrates that the synchronous Publisher sends a sequence of events in the caller's thread, and the synchronous Subscribers receive the sequence of events in the Publisher's thread _in sequence_.

### Asynchronous publisher and subscriber

The following code example demonstrates an asynchronous _cold_ Publisher that sends a finite sequence of items from a given Iterator.

The following code sample demonstrates an asynchronous Subscriber that _pulls_ items one by one and logs received events. This asynchronous Subscriber executes its methods onSubscribe, onNext, onError, onComplete in a separate thread. The thread-safe, non-blocking ConcurrentLinkedQueue transfers the signals from the Publisherâ€™s thread to the Subscriberâ€™s thread. The AtomicBoolean mutex ensures that the signals are executed _serially_ even if they are executed asynchronously. The GitHub repository also has blackbox and whitebox unit tests to verify that this Subscriber meets the specification using its TCK.

The following code example demonstrates that the _multicast_ Publisher sends the same sequence of events (the same pangram) to multiple Subscribers.


```
ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

List<String> list = List.of("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.".split(" "));
AsyncIteratorPublisher<String> publisher = new AsyncIteratorPublisher<>(() -> List.copyOf(list).iterator(), 1024, executorService);

AsyncSubscriber<String> subscriber1 = new AsyncSubscriber<>(1, executorService);
publisher.subscribe(subscriber1);

AsyncSubscriber<String> subscriber2 = new AsyncSubscriber<>(2, executorService);
publisher.subscribe(subscriber2);

subscriber1.awaitCompletion();
subscriber2.awaitCompletion();

executorService.shutdown();
executorService.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
```


The following log shows that an asynchronous Publisher sends a sequence of events in a separate thread, and that asynchronous Subscribers receive a sequence of events in a separate thread _in parallel_.
