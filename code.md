## Code examples


### Synchronous publisher and subscriber

The following code example demonstrates a synchronous Producer that sends a finite sequence of items from a given Iterator.

The following code sample demonstrates a synchronous Consumer that _pulls_ items one by one and logs received events.

The following code example demonstrates that the multicast Producer sends the same sequence of events (_[The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_quick_brown_fox_jumps_over_the_lazy_dog)_ pangram) to multiple Subscribers.


```
List<String> list = List.of("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.".split(" "));
SyncIteratorPublisher<String> publisher = new SyncIteratorPublisher<>(() -> List.copyOf(list).iterator());

SyncSubscriber<String> subscriber1 = new SyncSubscriber<>(1);
publisher.subscribe(subscriber1);

SyncSubscriber<String> subscriber2 = new SyncSubscriber<>(2);
publisher.subscribe(subscriber2);

subscriber1.awaitCompletion();
subscriber2.awaitCompletion();
```


The following log demonstrates that the synchronous Producer sends a sequence of events in the caller's thread, and the synchronous Consumers receive the sequence of events in the Producer's thread _in sequence_.

```



### Asynchronous publisher and subscriber

The following code example demonstrates an asynchronous Producer that sends a finite sequence of items from a given Iterator.

The following code sample demonstrates an asynchronous Consumer that _pulls_ items one by one and logs received events.

The following code example demonstrates that the multicast Producer sends the same sequence of events (_[The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_quick_brown_fox_jumps_over_the_lazy_dog)_ pangram) to multiple Subscribers.


```
ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

List<String> list = List.of("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.".split(" "));
AsyncIteratorPublisher<String> publisher = new AsyncIteratorPublisher<>(() -> List.copyOf(list).iterator(), 1024, executorService);

AsyncSubscriber<String> subscriber1 = new AsyncSubscriber<>(1, executorService);
publisher.subscribe(subscriber1);

AsyncSubscriber<String> subscriber2 = new AsyncSubscriber<>(2, executorService);
publisher.subscribe(subscriber2);

subscriber1.awaitCompletion();
subscriber2.awaitCompletion();

executorService.shutdown();
executorService.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
```


The following log shows that an asynchronous Producer sends a sequence of events in a separate thread, and that asynchronous Consumers receive a sequence of events in a separate thread _in parallel_.

The GitHub repository also has examples of how a synchronous Producer sends events to asynchronous Consumers and how an asynchronous Producer sends events to synchronous Consumers.
