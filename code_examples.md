# Reactive Streams specification in Java


## Code examples


### Cold synchronous reactive stream

The following code example demonstrates a synchronous Publisher that sends a finite sequence of events from an Iterator. The _synchronous_ Publisher processes the _Publisher.subscribe_, _Subscription.request_, _ Subscription.cancel_ methods in the caller’s thread. The _multicast_  Publisher can send items to multiple Subscribers, storing information about each connection in a private implementation of the Subscription interface. It includes the current Iterator instance, the demand (the aggregated number of items requested by a Subscriber which is yet to be delivered by the Publisher), and the connection cancellation flag. To make a _cold_ Publisher that sends the same sequence of events for each Subscriber, the Publisher stores a Supplier that must return a new Iterator instance for each new Subscription. The Publisher uses different types of error handling (throwing an exception or calling the _Subscriber.onError_ method) according to the Reactive Streams specification.

<sub>The GitHub repository has unit tests to verify that this Publisher complies with all the specification rules that are checked in its TCK.</sub>
